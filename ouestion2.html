<!-- Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?Semantic tags in HTML are specific elements that provide meaning and structure to the content within a web page. These tags describe the purpose or role of the content they wrap, making it easier for search engines, assistive technologies, and developers to understand and interpret the page's structure.

Here are some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5:

<header>: Represents the introductory or navigational content at the top of a page or section.
<nav>: Defines a section of navigation links.
<main>: Signifies the main content of the document.
<article>: Defines an independent, self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
<section>: Represents a standalone section within a document.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, like sidebars or pull quotes.
<footer>: Defines the footer of a document or a section.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Used together to encapsulate images or multimedia content along with their captions.
<blockquote>: Indicates a longer quotation or citation.
<cite>: Specifies the title of a work being referenced.
The use of semantic tags brings several benefits:

Accessibility: Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing clearer structure and meaning to assistive technologies like screen readers. They help visually impaired users navigate and understand the content more easily.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on the structure and semantics of a page to determine its relevance and ranking in search results. By using semantic tags, you can enhance the search engine visibility of your content.

Code Maintenance: Semantic tags make the HTML code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain. They help developers understand the purpose and structure of the content, making it simpler to modify or update the page in the future.

Interoperability: Semantic tags promote interoperability and consistency across different platforms, devices, and browsers. They provide a standardized way of describing content, ensuring more predictable rendering and behavior.

In summary, semantic tags in HTML improve accessibility, SEO, code maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility. They enable a clearer and more structured representation of web content, benefiting both developers and users. -->
