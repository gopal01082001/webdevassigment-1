<!-- Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use 
No, <!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag in HTML. It is called a Document Type Declaration (DTD) or document type definition. It is used to specify the version of HTML or XHTML that the web page is written in.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used in HTML5 to indicate that the document is written in the HTML5 markup language. It informs the web browser about the rules and specifications that should be used to interpret and display the web page.

The HTML5 specification introduced a simplified DOCTYPE declaration that consists of just <!DOCTYPE html>. This was done to make it easier for web developers and to promote consistent rendering across different browsers. In previous versions of HTML, the DOCTYPE declaration was more complex and specific, indicating the version of HTML being used.

Including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning of an HTML document is considered good practice as it helps ensure that the web page is interpreted correctly by modern web browsers. It sets the document mode to standards mode, which enables the browser to render the page according to the HTML5 specifications.

In summary, <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag, but rather a document type declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used in the document. -->
