<!-- Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes? -->
In HTML, the terms "tag" and "attribute" refer to different concepts:

HTML Tag: An HTML tag represents an element in an HTML document. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) and can be either an opening tag, a closing tag, or a self-closing tag. Tags define the structure and semantics of the content within the document. For example:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. The "p" represents the HTML element "paragraph."

HTML Attribute: An HTML attribute provides additional information about an HTML element. Attributes are used within the opening tag of an element and provide details or instructions related to that element. They are written as name-value pairs, with the attribute name followed by an equals sign (=) and the attribute value enclosed in quotes. For example:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
In this example, src and alt are attributes of the <img> tag. The src attribute specifies the source URL of the image, while the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image.

Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. They are not specific to any particular element and can be applied universally. Some examples of global attributes include:

class: Specifies one or more class names for an element, allowing CSS and JavaScript to target and style the element.
id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, which can be used to target the element in CSS or JavaScript.
style: Specifies inline CSS styles for an element.
title: Specifies a title or tooltip for an element.
lang: Specifies the language of the element's content.
tabindex: Specifies the tab order of an element when navigating using the keyboard.
data-*: Allows the addition of custom data attributes to elements for storing extra information.
These global attributes can be used with various HTML elements to enhance their functionality and appearance.
