<!-- Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?Q.
In HTML, the terms "tags" and "elements" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to slightly different concepts:

HTML Tags: HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are used to define the structure and formatting of the content within the document. HTML tags are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and are usually written in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag defines the beginning of an element, and the closing tag defines its end. For example:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. The "p" represents the HTML element "paragraph."

HTML Elements: HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (although some elements may not have closing tags). An HTML element includes both the tags and the content between them. The content can be text, other nested elements, or a combination of both. Elements define the structure and semantics of the content within an HTML document. For example:

html
Copy code
<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
In this example, <h1> is the opening tag, </h1> is the closing tag, and "Welcome to my website!" is the content. The "h1" represents the HTML element "heading level 1."

So, to summarize, HTML tags are the individual markers that define the beginning and end of an element, while HTML elements include both the tags and the content between them. Elements are used to structure and define the content within an HTML document. -->
